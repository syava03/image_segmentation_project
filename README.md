# Human Image Segmentation
In this project, I built a Convolution neural network in Pytorch using U-Net architecture on a Human Segmentation Dataset. I trained a model to identify a person in a picture, highlight him/her, and change the background. 
The project is broken down into multiple steps:
- Load and preprocess the image dataset.
- Train the image segmentation model on the dataset.
- Use the trained model to predict the image mask.
- Evaluation.
